PR: Implement Browser Notifications and Date Filtering


1. Browser Notifications:
   - Browser notifications are displayed when new articles are fetched
   - Notifications aggregate new articles matching the specified dates and keywords across all companies in the watchlist
   - Single article notifications display the title and a snippet of the description
   - Multiple article notifications show the first article title and the count of additional articles

2. Date Filtering:
   - Users can now specify start and end dates when fetching news
   - The date range is saved to session state so switching pages doesnt reset the range

3. Other:
   - Made the watchlist case-insensitive

Demo:

 - show all article fetch
 - show end of the month
 - show that it works with keywords
 -

Acceptance criteria:

Settings page & All News Page:
Settings page:
The watchlist and keywords list will now be accessible in one settings page

All news page:
This page will display a table of all the available news (in this case, mock data).
Table columns will include: Title, Company, URL, Source, Published At, Description, and Content.
The user can filter by company, source, and date range.
The user can search the articles.
The user can sort by source, company, and published date.

Duplicate Prevention :

I'll use a Python NLP library with a text similarity model to identify duplicate or near-duplicate articles
When duplicate articles are detected, they are grouped together under a single primary article The primary article has a new field called "duplicates" which contains links to all detected duplicate articles
The "duplicates" field is visible on the article log page and can be expanded to show all duplicate articles
Duplicate articles are not shown as separate entries in the main article log, but are accessible through the primary article
The duplicate detection process runs automatically when new articles are fetched


Article Log:

- Every time news is fetched, the new unique filtered articles are added to the database and displayed in the article log.
- There is a ‘clear log’ button (for testing).
- By default, the article log shows articles from all companies on the watchlist.
- The user can filter the list by company.
- The same article cannot be added to the log twice.


- Moved the watchlist and keywords list to a single ‘Settings’ page.
- If there are no articles matching the dates and keywords, display ‘No articles found for {company name}’
- Added Anthropic, Bank of America, and Neuralink mock data
- Created the ‘All News’ page
    - Displays a table with all the news in the mock data
    - User can filter by company, source, and date range
    - User can search the articles (title, description, and content)
    - User can sort by clicking on a column (sorted by publishing date by default)


   Touchpoint notes:

  - The table a bit content heavy. UI should be cleaner, more open, and less cluttered.
- Take out the url column and hyperlink the titles.
- Take out the content column — having both content and description is redundant.
- Find a way to wrap text - as opposed to it being cut off.
- Explore a news card display (reference code week project).
- Clean up the data
    - Remove rows with any missing fields
    - Filter out the non english articles
- Start thinking about end to end user experience.
    - There should be a button where I can add those filters as an alert.
    - If I’m searching  news and find a combination of filters that I like, I should be able to add that as an alert via a button.
- The settings page should be the last on the navigation panel.
