PR: Implement Browser Notifications and Date Filtering


1. Browser Notifications:
   - Browser notifications are displayed when new articles are fetched
   - Notifications aggregate new articles matching the specified dates and keywords across all companies in the watchlist
   - Single article notifications display the title and a snippet of the description
   - Multiple article notifications show the first article title and the count of additional articles

2. Date Filtering:
   - Users can now specify start and end dates when fetching news
   - The date range is saved to session state so switching pages doesnt reset the range

3. Other:
   - Made the watchlist case-insensitive

Demo:

 - show all article fetch
 - show end of the month
 - show that it works with keywords
